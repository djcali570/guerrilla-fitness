00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.630
So I started at Guerrilla Fitness back in the summer of 2018

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.900
When I started,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I really struggled to do

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
almost all of the movements here.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.000
In about 7 years being here

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.500
it's really incredible the transformation that i've had

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.500
and, I really trusted kind of the process

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.000
and trusted the coaching

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.800
and programming of the gym.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.600
Everybody gives you

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.200
really, really

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.900
individualized attention

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.600
they make sure

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.600
that they're coaching you on

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.800
the specific things that you need to work on

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.700
now i'm able to rx most of the workouts here

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.800
I feel great

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.400
I come in 4 days a week

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.900
and I think that's a testament to just

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.300
taking it slow and steady

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.500
and following the guidance

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.900
that the coaches have given me
