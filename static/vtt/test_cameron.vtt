I'm Cameron.

00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:02.150
I'm a member of Guerrilla Fitness

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.840
I've been a member since I think the summer of 2016.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.390
I think the thing that impressed me,

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.450
surprised me the most about it was just the sense of community that Joe and Greg and everybody here

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:12.180
helped bring together.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.120
You have people from all different walks of life,

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.120
people from all different

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.540
levels of fitness,

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:17.450
all working together,

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.180
all putting in the same level of effort,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.540
all supporting one another and motivating each other and it's a real community.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:24.780
You make friends here,

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.000
they have a wonderful kind of community building experiences and i could see myself staying here for a long

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.360
time.
